Open Adjudication Protocol (OAP)
Product Requirements Document (PRD)
________________________________________
1. Product Overview
Product Name: Open Adjudication Protocol (OAP)
Product Type: B2B Trust & Safety Infrastructure (API-first, doctrine-driven)
Purpose: OAP provides a transparent, AI-assisted reasoning layer for online disputes and moderation events. It does not issue verdicts or enforce penalties. Instead, it produces structured, explainable analyses that make conflicts intelligible, defensible, and auditable for platforms, moderators, users, and regulators.
OAP is designed to reduce moderation opacity, user churn, regulatory risk, and operational overhead while preserving human agency and community-specific norms.

2. Problem Statement
Online platforms face three systemic challenges:
1.	Perceived Unfairness: Users disengage or escalate when moderation decisions appear arbitrary or unexplained.
2.	Operational Cost: Human moderation is expensive, slow, inconsistent, and psychologically taxing.
3.	Regulatory Pressure: Regulations (e.g., EU Digital Services Act) require clear, timely “statements of reasons” for moderation decisions.
Existing solutions focus on enforcement (bans, removals) rather than legibility of reasoning.
OAP addresses this gap by standardizing how decisions are explained, not what decisions are made.

3. Target Customers & Users
Primary Customers (Buyers)
•	Online platforms (forums, marketplaces, social networks)
•	Community-hosting SaaS products
•	Marketplaces with dispute resolution workflows
•	Trust & Safety and Compliance teams
End Users (Non-buyers)
•	Community moderators
•	Platform administrators
•	Disputing users (view-only access to analysis)
•	Legal and compliance reviewers

4. Core Product Philosophy
OAP is norm-agnostic but procedurally fixed.
•	OAP does not define values or community standards.
•	Adopting platforms supply their own rules, guidelines, and policies.
•	OAP guarantees a transparent, consistent, and humble reasoning process applied to those rules.

5. OAP Doctrine (System Constraints)
The system must always comply with the OAP Doctrine:
1.	Radical Visibility — All reasoning is visible to involved parties by default.
2.	Whiteboard Mandate — Illuminate disputes; never issue verdicts.
3.	Epistemic Humility — Explicitly state uncertainty and missing context.
4.	Separation of Facts and Values — Analyze actions and text, not character or intent.
5.	Human-in-Control — AI outputs are advisory and non-enforcing.
6.	Consistency Over Outcome — Procedural fairness over engineered results.
7.	Norm Source Declaration — All evaluative criteria must be explicitly supplied and cited.
These principles are immutable and override all customer configuration.

6. Core Features (MVP)
6.1 Dispute Analysis Engine (API)
Input: - Conversation transcript - Platform-supplied community rules - Optional moderator context
Output (Structured JSON): - Neutral summary of each party’s claims - Identified points of agreement and disagreement - Rule citations with exact quoted text - Areas of ambiguity or missing information - Emotional escalation indicators (non-diagnostic) - Resolution space (possible paths forward)
The engine must refuse to proceed if no applicable rule can be cited.
________________________________________
6.2 Citation Anchoring (Safety-Critical)
•	Every evaluative statement must cite an exact rule clause.
•	If no citation exists, the system must:
o	Explicitly state the absence
o	Escalate for human review
•	No inferred, paraphrased, or invented rules are permitted.
This is a hard safety gate.
________________________________________
6.3 Transparent Output View
•	Analysis is visible to all dispute participants by default.
•	Platforms may restrict visibility only for safety or legal reasons.
•	Any restriction must itself be disclosed in-system.
________________________________________
6.4 Moderator Review Mode (Optional)
•	Moderators can review AI analysis before sharing.
•	Moderators may add human annotations.
•	AI cannot override or bypass human decisions.

12. Long-Term Vision
OAP aims to become a reference standard for transparent dispute reasoning across online platforms—providing a shared procedural language for explaining decisions without centralizing moral authority.
OAP succeeds when disagreements remain human, but chaos does not.
